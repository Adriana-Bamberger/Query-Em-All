# Query-em-all

This is a very basic Pokedex that uses Vite to bundle a React app and tailwind for simple styling.

Due to time constraints it is not reprsentive of what I would like to have built, or what I believe I am capable of building, But I think it's a pretty good starting point for the about 2 hours of work I had available.


## Installation
In your terminal (I use WSL, Ubuntu) Clone the new repo to your local machine, `git clone...`

Install the node packages `Npm install`, 

Then start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds the code, run `npm run dev`.

## Notes from Creation.
 
Using both interface and type is not necessary in this case, and using only interface is a more consistent and idiomatic approach in TypeScript.
However, there are cases where using type can be useful, such as when defining a union type or an intersection type.

Functionality to see more details on the pokemons is currently commented out, this is one of a few ways I coud think to do this.
